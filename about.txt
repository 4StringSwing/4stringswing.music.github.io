Hello everyone! So you want to know a little bit about me? Well to start off 
I am a bass player from Canada, I've been playing bass for about 6 months. 
Before that I played around with making electronic music but then fell in love 
with the bass. I am constantly working on inproving my skills and I am so happy to have you along for the ride. I try to upload and/or stream every monday but I will upload during the week from time to time. Take a look around my page if you would like, 
some features are not available yet but they will be soon.
